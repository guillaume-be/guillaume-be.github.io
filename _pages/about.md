My name's Guillaume and I am a Deep Learning Engineer with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP). Having recently discovered the Rust programming language, I started a few projects aiming at growing its machine learning and NLP ecosystem. This is why I created and am maintaining the [rust-tokenizers](https://github.com/guillaume-be/rust-tokenizers) and [rust-bert](https://github.com/guillaume-be/rust-bert) packages.

As I was working on these projects, I realized that the Rust language is an ideal fit for NLP project at various complexity levels. I would like to share here some thoughts and lesson I've learned during the implementation I hope will benefit data scientists getting started with Rust (or the other way around...)

Thanks for reading!
